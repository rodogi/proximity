# Proximity NetMed

Proximity is a package for the calculation of network-based distances like proximity and separation.

## Proximity
First introduced in the paper "Network-based in silico drug efficacy screening" by Guney et al. 2016, proximity is a distance measure based on shortest paths between two sets of nodes in the protein-protein interaction network.

## Separation
The separation between two set of nodes is a network-based measure introduced in the paper "Uncovering disease-disease relationships through the incomplete interactome" by Menche et al. 2015.
